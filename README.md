# esx-legacy-roleplay-server-2
This is a FiveM esx legacy roleplay server. It's the secound version i make and i will most likely make a third.

The server contains almost everything you need and all of the scripts are free and open source so thanks to all of the other developers who makes this possible.

All the info about the server and how to set it up can be found inside of the install folder in the readme.
